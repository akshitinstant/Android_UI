    <string name="content">CoordinatorLayout is a powerful ViewGroup in Android that enables complex View coordination and animations between child views. It\'s part of the Android Design Support Library (now under androidx.coordinatorlayout.widget.CoordinatorLayout). 🔹 Definition: CoordinatorLayout is a super-powered FrameLayout that allows views to interact with one another using Behaviors. It is mainly used to implement material design components like AppBarLayout, CollapsingToolbarLayout, FloatingActionButton, Snackbar, etc. 🔹 Use Case: Collapsing toolbars (e.g., scroll-to-collapse header with toolbar and image). FloatingActionButton hide/show on scroll. Snackbar pushing up views like FAB. Swipe-to-dismiss views. AppBarLayout with TabLayout and ViewPager. 🔹 Advantages: Supports complex view hierarchies and interactions. Easy integration with Material Design components. Enables declarative linking of view behavior (e.g., scrolling effects). Reduces boilerplate logic for animation and movement. 🔹 Disadvantages: Slightly steeper learning curve due to Behaviors and nested scrolling. Can become overcomplicated if overused. Debugging interactions between views might be difficult. Not suitable for simple layouts.CoordinatorLayout is a powerful ViewGroup in Android that enables complex View coordination and animations between child views.
